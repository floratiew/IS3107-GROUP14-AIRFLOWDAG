# HDB Price Predictor Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for the HDB Price Predictor web application, focusing on:

1. Backend proxy service for GCS and BigQuery integration
2. XGBoost model inference in JavaScript
3. UI/UX improvements for better user experience

## Backend Proxy Service

A backend proxy service has been implemented to handle GCS and BigQuery operations:

### Key Implementation Details

- **Express Server**: A Node.js Express server that handles API requests from the frontend
- **GCS Integration**: The backend loads the model from GCS and serves it to the frontend
- **BigQuery Integration**: The backend executes BigQuery queries and transforms the results for the frontend
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for development

### Code Structure

The backend service is organized as follows:

- **server.js**: Main entry point for the Express server
- **routes/model.js**: API routes for model operations
- **routes/bigquery.js**: API routes for BigQuery operations
- **services/gcsService.js**: Service for GCS operations
- **services/bigQueryService.js**: Service for BigQuery operations

### Frontend Integration

The frontend services have been updated to use the backend API:

- **modelService.ts**: Updated to fetch the model from the backend API
- **dataService.ts**: Updated to fetch visualization data from the backend API

## XGBoost Inference Implementation

A simplified XGBoost inference implementation has been added to the application:

### Key Implementation Details

- **XGBoost Inference**: A JavaScript implementation of XGBoost inference has been added to the application
- **Feature Preprocessing**: The implementation includes a function to preprocess features for XGBoost prediction
- **Model Loading**: The implementation includes a function to load the XGBoost model from JSON
- **Prediction**: The implementation includes a function to make predictions using the loaded model

### Code Structure

The `xgboostInference.ts` file has been added with:

- Types for XGBoost model structure
- Functions for loading and processing XGBoost models
- Functions for making predictions using XGBoost models
- Functions for preprocessing features for XGBoost prediction

## Development Setup

To run the application in development mode:

1. **Start the Backend Service**:
   ```bash
   cd testapp/backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Application**:
   ```bash
   cd testapp/pricepred
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend service will handle GCS and BigQuery operations, while the frontend will focus on UI and inference.

## Input Mapping Implementation

The application has been updated with a proper implementation of input mapping:

### Feature Mapping

- The `mapInputsToModelFeatures` function in `modelService.ts` has been updated to use the preprocessFeatures function from `xgboostInference.ts`
- The function now properly maps user inputs to the features required by the model
- Additional features are added as needed for the model

### Required Model Features

The application is prepared to handle the following model features:

- Basic features: `month`, `town`, `flat_type`, `floor_area_sqm`, `flat_model`, etc.
- Derived features: `remaining_lease_months`, `years_from_lease`, etc.
- One-hot encoded features: `flat_type_X`, `town_X`, `flat_model_X`, etc.

## UI/UX Improvements

The application has been enhanced with better UI/UX:

### Visualization Improvements

- Added better error handling and debugging capabilities
- Added a static test chart to verify Chart.js is working properly
- Improved the layout and styling of the visualization view

### Responsive Design

- Fixed layout issues for mobile devices
- Added proper responsive breakpoints
- Enhanced the navigation with mobile support

### Visual Enhancements

- Added loading indicators during model loading and prediction
- Improved form validation and feedback
- Enhanced the overall visual design with better colors and spacing

## Advantages of the Backend Proxy Approach

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The backend handles GCS and BigQuery operations, while the frontend focuses on UI and inference
2. **Security**: GCS and BigQuery credentials are kept on the server side, not exposed to the client
3. **Compatibility**: Works in all browsers without compatibility issues
4. **Scalability**: The backend can be deployed to a cloud service like Google Cloud Run for production use

## Future Work

The following items are planned for future implementation:

1. **Production Deployment**: Deploy the backend to a service like Google Cloud Run or App Engine
2. **Authentication**: Add authentication to the backend API
3. **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for BigQuery queries
4. **Additional Visualizations**: Add more visualizations for better data exploration
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for better performance

## Notes for Developers

- The `modelService.ts` file contains detailed comments about the implementation
- The `xgboostInference.ts` file includes detailed comments about the XGBoost inference implementation
- The `bigQueryService.ts` file includes detailed comments about the BigQuery integration
- The `VisualizationView.vue` file includes debugging tools to help identify issues
- The application is designed to be easily extended with new features
