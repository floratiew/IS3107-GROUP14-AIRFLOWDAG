# IS3107 Group Project - HDB Resale Price Prediction

Welcome!  
This project combines data engineering, machine learning, and web development to help us understand and predict HDB resale prices in Singapore using real-world datasets and automated workflows.

## Project Overview

This repository is organized into three main components:

### 1. **Airflow_Dag**  
Contains our Airflow pipeline, which automates the retrieval and processing of datasets such as HDB resale prices, MRT locations, school information, unemployment rates, and more.

### 2. **Downstream Application**  
This is our web app, where processed data and model outputs are displayed in an interactive and accessible format.

### 3. **machine_learning**  
Houses our Jupyter notebooks and scripts for manually training and evaluating different machine learning models to find the best one for price prediction.
